        <h1 className='text-2xl'>About me:</h1>
        <p >My name is #####, and I decided to change my occupation after five years of working in sales. I still like communicating with people and work in a team. I want to alter the accents a bit and switch to product management. As a sales agent, I learned what makes a product valuable and easy to sell besides promotion and persuasiveness. I have been working “on the other side” long enough to realize how important marketing and development components are. I have become interested in these fields recently. I am certain that joining your team is a benefit for both sides. My professional expertise in sales can provide valuable insights and a fresh perspective on product development. Personally, I can acquire new knowledge and skills in product launch and management. I am ready for long-time cooperation.
